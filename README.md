# Shortest Path Finder

## Overview

Shortest Path Finder is a tool for finding the shortest path between nodes in a graph. It supports various algorithms like Dijkstra's and A* to compute the optimal route in weighted graphs.

## Features

- **Shortest Path Algorithms**: Implements algorithms such as Dijkstra's and A* for finding the shortest path.
- **Graph Visualization**: Visualizes graphs and paths.
- **Flexible Input**: Accepts different graph representations and input formats.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/umuterdev/ShortestPathFinder.git
   cd ShortestPathFinder
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   Manually install the required packages using:

   ```bash
   pip install numpy networkx
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the Program**:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

2. **Input Graph**: Provide the graph data and specify the start and end nodes for which you want to find the shortest path.

3. **View Results**: The program will output the shortest path and the associated cost between the specified nodes.
